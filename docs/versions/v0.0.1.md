# Version 0.0.1

## Description
Current version acts as the MVP (minimal working product) and ships the
minimal (but tested) functionality. It uses the Docker compose to conteinerize 
Spring Boot app and PostgreSQL database.

6. [How to build app](#how-to-build-app)

## Features
* Almost 100% test coverage ("almost" because it's just an MVP)
* Base functionality
* Base64 security (will be replaced in the future releases with a better one)
* Nice exception handling for the beginning 
* Profiles for all 3 cases: dev, prod, and test
* Only integration tests

## Bugs, errors, TODOs
* The exception response is not *very*
* The account doesn't support Spring Security's `UserDetails` features such as enabled, expired, locked etc
* There is no email verification for account during creation
* There is no way to reset password
* `@Transactional` in the `#delete` method of `DefaultWordService` was removed, since when is called from the controller the `TransientObjectException` appears

## API and Swagger
As mentioned current version ships the Base64 Security. If the `api-docs.json`
file is not enough for you and you'd like to get more info, start the app
and visit the Swagger's endpoint: `/swagger-ui/index.html`. That page is 
autogenerated by the Swagger. 

## How to Run App?
You can run app in one of the following profies: dev, test, prod. Before running
make sure the required profile files (like `/config/.env.<PROFILE>`, 
`/docker/docker-compose.<PROFILE>.yml`) exist.

### Method 1: outside Docker
Great for local usage. It means to runs as you'd type: `./gradlew bootRun`, 
but with wrappers and checks

Just run the `run.sh <profile>` and follow instructions. App runs locally 
on your host and  database in container.

But what happens under the hood?
* It checks config files
* Applies env vars
* Stops another containers
* Locally overrides datasource url
* Starts docker profile-specific DB container

How it runs app?
1. `dev` or `prod` profiles simply: `./gradlew clean bootRun`
2. `test` via `./gradlew clean test <ARGS>`, so if something breaks, then you see a poor output, 
<u>consider testing app via your IDE</u>, unless you speicifed an argument, like `--info`
when asked

### Method 2: inside Docker
Run `docker-run.sh <profile>` and follow instructions. 

Unless you said not to, app will be **built** and runned in the Docker container. 

## How to Build App?
### Method 1: just get executable jar
Run `build-jar.sh`, it won't run any tests

### Method 2: build the an image (production)
Keep in mind that some other scripts also do that to run the app (the jar file)
inside! 

Run `docker-build.sh` - it will prepare the app to the production. Under the 
hood it does:
* Check config files
* Test the app (starts test container and then stops it)
* Builds the jar file
* Tags created image (with the version specified and as `:latest`)
