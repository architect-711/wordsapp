# ðŸ“– WordsApp Documentation

For more info about particular versions look for the files named similar 
to `vX.X.X.md` in the `/versions` subfolder

## ðŸ”Ž Description
This file provides the basic info about the whole project to quickly onboard.
It doesn't teach you how to build a particular release and neither tells you
about its features or bugs.

## Table of contents
In this file you'll find:
1. [Where to find the API config files](#api)
2. [The commits styles](#the-commits-style)
3. [Info about tests](#tests)
4. [Project structure logic](#project-structure)
5. [Importand remakres about some directories](#important-remarks-about-directories)

<!-- <a name="api"/> -->
## API
The `/api` subfolder contains the `api-docs.json` file. It's auto generated
but the Swagger and represents the OpenAPI definition. So you can easily
import it to the postman. 

## The commits style
Use only the style described in the [conventional commits site](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)

## Tests
This is the most crucial part of the app. Here, I keep the one simple rule:
"No test - not feature".

**How to write a good test?**

I've tried many approaches but stopped on the one: **each test is independent
and standalone and must leave nothing after it**!!! It must every single time in the beginning save what it need
and at the end clean everything. <u>In some cases you can reject of this pratice, but
make sure it's justified. Because some tests might require the database to be empty!</u>

To reach that the `@AfterAll` and `@BeforeAll` methods exist. They might, for example,
clear the `SecurityContextHolder` for you.

This is why the testing is usually done in the Docker container database

```

### The app code
The logic is simple: each feature has it's own dedicated directory. Follow the logic:
* It's a controller? - put to the `/controller` folder. 
* It's a service - put to the `/service` folder
* It's a service util? - put to the `/service/utils` folder
* It maps DTOs, POJOs or Entities? - `/model/mapper` folder is for you and etc.
* etc

So the FS should look something like this (this is just an **example**):
```

```

## Important remarks about directories
### `/config`
The app relies on external configuration, such as the database URL, credentials,
profile etc.
They are passed via the environment variables. So you have to **create this directory
manually** (due to the private content it's not tracked) and put these 3 files (unless some profiles you don't use):
* `.env.dev` - for dev config
* `.env.prod` - for prod config
* `.env.test` - for test config

Each of them must conclude at least next variables:
```env
export POSTGRES_USERNAME=
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
export POSTGRES_HOST_PORT=

export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://<DB_SERVICE>:5432/wordsapp
```
<u>Pay attention, the `scripts/run.sh` overrides `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` for 
a session, because it runs app outside of the docker container, but specified
line works only with container-to-container communication</u>

If you don't know what to put here, leave this:
```
export POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test
export POSTGRES_HOST_PORT=5433

export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db_dev:5432/wordsapp
```

### `/docker`
This folder contains 3 files:
* `docker-compose.dev.yml`
* `docker-compose.prod.yml`
* `docker-compose.test.yml`

They all are responsible for the PostgreSQL database container configuration
for each of the profile. Yes, it might create 3 containers, altough
when using scripts under the `scripts/` folder this never happens.

You might even don't look inside, just keep configuration files carefully.

### `/scripts`
Each command logs errors in the `/logs/wordsapp.build.log` (might be changed in
the `utils.sh`) file since it uses Docker, if somthing breaks down (like the 
command suddenly finished) - visit this file.

This folder helps a developer to manage the whole app. Of course, you
can avoid using them and manually feed the `.env.{profile}` file for your favourite IDE/shell, manually start required DB containers, manually build a JAR file etc.

Anyway, the list of current possibilities:

`build-jar.sh` - build the executable jar file

<hr>

`run.sh <profile>` - run app locally (almost like `./gradlew bootRun`).
Database is in the container

<hr>

`docker-run.sh <profile>` - run app in the container alike the DB

<hr>

`docker-build.sh` - Production build app, app testing included, so all
files with `test` profile must exist

<hr>

`docker-db-run.sh <profile>` - start a particular DB container

<hr>

`docker-stop.sh <profile>` - stop particlar containers with profile

<hr>

`docker-save.sh` - save an image to the *.gz file: 

<hr>

`save-config.sh` - save config. It means to generate a .tar.gz file, that
contains the whole configuration  and the (optional) saved image .gz file.
Helpful when want to quickly deploy the whole app to the server, or when
don't have the source code, but want to run app

Consider runnning after the `docker-save`, to have a possibility to 
add the docker image also.

The configuration concludes files under: 
1. `config/` - you specify them, again it doesn't really matter, 
they might be changed anyway, might be empty
2. `docker/`
3. `scripts/`, but only these files: 
    * `docker-run-db.sh`
    * `docker-run.sh`
    * `docker-stop.sh`
    * `utils.sh`

<hr>

`utils.sh` file contains all often used functions and configuration variables,
such as the `LOG_DIR`, `PROFILES` etc.
