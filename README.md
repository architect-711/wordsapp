# WordsApp

## Description
When you learn new language you write down new words in some notebook,
but it quickly gets too hard to maintain it: lookup, insert, sorting is
immensely hard or impossible.
<p>
This app acts as a replacement with upgrades, you can do more than just
save new words: add them to groups, repeat them with the Quiz mode.

## API
The `docs/` folder contains API files and its README.md file to help you
to comprehence this app or get onboard.

## How to build and run app?

As of today the app is in development mode, so the only one way is to
<b>pull source code</b>. You need Java 23 and PostreSQL installed. Then visit 
`/src/main/resources/application.properties` file to configure database connection.

## Tech Stack
