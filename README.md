# 📖 WordsApp

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
The app is in the MVP state, and also hasn't got a frontend - now it's just
a backend.

## 📜 Description
When you learn new language you write down new words in some notebook,
but it quickly gets too hard to maintain it: lookup, insert, sorting is
immensely hard or impossible.
<p>
This app acts as a replacement with upgrades, you can do more than just
save new words: add them to groups, specify description, definition
use cases, translations, transcriptions.

## 📊 Documentation
To learn how to build, run and use the app, get the API navigate to the `docs/` folder it will answer on each technical question.
