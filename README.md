# WordsApp

## Description
When you learn new language you write down new words in some notebook,
but it quickly gets too hard to maintain it: lookup, insert, sorting is
immensely hard or impossible. This app acts as a replacement with
upgrades, you can do more than just save new words: saves words to groups,
repeat them with the Quiz mode.

## API
Search in `/docs/` folder for the Yaak json config.

## How to build and run app?

<b>pull source code</b>. You need Java 23 and PostreSQL installed. Then visit 
`/src/main/resources/application.properties` file to configure database connection.
